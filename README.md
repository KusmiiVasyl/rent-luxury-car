## About The App

This site is intended for renting luxury cars. We can view cars using a slide, list, see car characteristics, add (delete) cars to favorites, add (delete) car to the garage. In the slide, you can also watch a video trailer about this car. When you click on car rental, the car rental form opens, but only if the user has entered his data, if not, then a corresponding message will be displayed from which we can immediately proceed to registration. In the user data entry form, you need to enter the relevant data and you can add a photo. When the car rental form is filled out and sent, the lessor receives an email with all the information and then we can contact the lessee.
